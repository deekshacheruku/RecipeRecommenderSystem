<b> Had Cravings..? </b>

<b> Wanted To have foods of your kind..? </b>

<b> Get them recommended!</b>

I have build a basic Recommender System which uses TFIDVECTORIZER method in SCILEARN library of Python and recommends the top 10 list for you.

The system shall provide recommendations based on the ranking of the keywords present in the dataset. I have used flask to integrate the user page and the recommender system. 

All you have to do is to give a input of your favourite recipe and wait for the list.

You have the list but don't know how to cook? No worries! The web page also shows you the procedure to make it!
